### 1. Identifying best-case/worst-case scenario with Time Complexity

Best-Case scenario depends on the number of iterations you must go through with a certain sorting algorithm before it will finish.

Worst-Case scenario assumes that all elements will need sorting (the maximum number of iterations possible with a certain sorting algorithm).

See below for a conversion between best-case (or rather, n'th case) to worst-case where n is the number of elements in the array.
